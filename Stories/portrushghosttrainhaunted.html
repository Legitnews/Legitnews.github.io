<i>Barry's Amusements</i> in Portrush had to close early this morning, due to complaints from customers of "Ghoulish noises" and "The whispers of demons" emanating from the <i>Ghost Train</i>, one of the park's main attractions. The scene has been cordoned off from the public and PSNI are investigating the matter.<br><br>One witness to this event  -- who wishes to remain anonymous -- has agreed to an exclusive interview with our correspondant. "Jaysus she were pure weak scurry", said out contact, "Pure dannerin through barry's when I hear this moanin' an' wailin' comin' frey the Ghos' Train, like she were fulla ghosts er somethin'. Ah tell ye I was beatin' on outty there fasser than a 306 D-Turbo".<br><br>The Reverend and Right Honourable Ian Paisley, The Lord Bannside, also made comment on this incedent. "I will repeat to you what I have been saying since Nineteen Eighty-Two, this despicable hive of sin masquerading as an "Amusement Park" can bring to loyal Ulster only the Three Ds: Drink, Drugs and Devilry".<br><br>Investigators on the scene have also reported an abnormally high pressure gradient in the area around the <i>Cyclone</i> ride. <br></font>
