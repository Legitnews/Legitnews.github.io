<p>President Obama today delivered a speech to a crowd of 20 000 about the threat to national security posed by Great Leader Rafferty of St. Louis Grammar School.
The speech referred to his predecessor's suspicious disappearance, which allowed him to take over the school with minimal resistance from the staff and students.
Obama further criticised his policy of support for Syria's ongoing chemical weapons program, and his ongoing embargo of the nearby retailer "TC's". Rafferty has since issued a response to President Obama's remarks,
stating "We will not tolerate further attacks on our school. Our North Korean allies will stand with us against this injustice."</p>

<p>The wikipedia page detailing Rafferty's rule has been taken down by the US government to avoid provoking a desire for war in the population against a
state with no resources to steal. It is somewhat preserved <a href = "WikipediaPage.html">here</a>.
