	"Avoid Bill II", the highly anticipated sequel to the critacally acclaimed "Avoid Bill" shipped today, and we<br>
	at Legit News have an exclusive interview with the lead and sole developer on the project, Bobby Clarke.<br>
	<br>
	LN : Thanks for meeting with us Bobby. Can I just say you've been a real inspiration?<br>
	<br>
	BC : Happy to be here, Kent. I like to spread my ideas with the world.<br>
	<br>
	LN : So, what motivated you to make the original "Avoid Bill"?<br>
	<br>
	BC : Well, Bill, it all started with an observation. I saw that games today were all violence and rage.<br>
		 I thought to myself, "I don't need that to make a great game!". Six months, $3 million and two<br>
		 failed publishing deals later, it turned out I did. At this point, I only had like two days left to<br>
		 finish the damn thing, but I still wanted to broaden people's horizons. So I decided "Hey, lets<br>
		 make the same violence-driven games everyone's used to, but with a new twist: It's really shit!".<br>
		 And so, here we are today.<br>
	<br> 
	LN : Fascinating. Truely fascinating. And why is it now that you've decided to revamp this series for
		 a second game? What can this new installment bring to the table?<br>
	<br>
	BC : It's funny you ask that, Tommy. The main driving force behind this game's development was<br>
		 the fact that the original game sold so well. So I got to thinking about how I could strike<br>
		 back with an even greater innovation for the market. Eventually, I decided I would make<br>
		 what is essentially the same game all over again and really suck those loyal wallets dry.<br>
	<br>
	LN : So what you're saying to me here, if I can truely hope to comprehend the words of a<br>
		 genius, is that you've sold out?<br>
	<br>
	BC : Exactly.<br>
	<br>
	LN : Astounding! You heard it here first folks, why not go <a href="http://legitnews.biz/Games/Avoid%20Bill%20II/index.html">try the game</a>, exclusive to LegitNews.
