We caught up with his agent for details.<br><br>"My man here", he began, "does operetta, baleretta, vienetta, castanetta, copa cabana, bermuda triange, hulk hogan, green machine, and tae kwon do."<br>Staring wistfully in to the horizon, he added "He also makes a damn fine Banana Daiquiri".<br><br>He refused to comment on the "Babe Wig Incident", stating only that it was in the past and should be forgotten.<br><br>He then challenged me to a game of Sjolen, in which I was soundly defeated.<br><br>Hugh plays "The Boy" in "The Girl in the Photograph", a philharmonic sci-fi thriller slated for release later in 2014.<br></font>
