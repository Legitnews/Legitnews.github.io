EPILOGUE:

For four days and three nights the man wandered outside, crossing paths with no other living soul.

At dusk of the fourth night, as though it were destined, he found himself returned to the bathroom he had once thought his prison.

Gratefully, he returned to the room, closing the door behind him, and took to sleep.

He awoke the next morning, once again beleiving he was locked in. The alternative was too much to bear.
