Hello there

Hello. I'm sending you an email like you asked.

So, how are you? I'm doing well.

Anyway, I've decided to share a little story with you about when I was helping my
father set up his account on the computer system. For some reason he got completely
hung up on trying to choose a password. I tried to tell him that it doesn't matter
but he wouldn't hear it. I don't even have one! It makes it so much simpler to log
in when you don't have to remember a password. Still, he wanted one and for some
reason just couldn't pick one. Eventually I said to him "I doesn't matter,
just make it anything!".

Well I have no idea what happened, but at that moment he typed something in
and we were finally able to move on. I don't know why he was finally able to
pick something, but I just thank the Lord he was.

I know that story wasn't very interesting, but frankly I can't think of much to
send you.

Look, this has gone on long enough. The truth is that I don't want anything more
to do with you. You're a married woman and I'm supposed to be celibate. This is
over.

Goodbye,
  Terrence Kinsley
