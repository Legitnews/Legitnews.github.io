Another Wife
leader
2021/04/21

Since I made you my wife, you have performed your duties admirably, make no
mistake about that. However, you will eventually be an old woman and I will
grow tired of you.

I have therefore decided that I will also make Mabel Davis my wife when she
comes of age. She is young and she is virginal, and will therefore make an
excellent second wife for my household.

And why should I not have multiple wives? Solomon had 700 wives, and am I not
a figure of his stature, or greater still? Furthermore, she has no-one else
to take her.

Now that you understand, I trust you will have no problem with my plan?
