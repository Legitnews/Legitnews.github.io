Dear Diary,

I have been dealing with a lot of emotions lately, so I've decided to start writing a 
diary.

It seems like ever since mother died, my life has been going to hell. She was
absolutely enamoured with this damn cult and its leader. I never saw the appeal in
that creep, even from the start. Still, I joined up to make her happy. I was scared
that she would disown me if I didn't.

At first it didn't really matter. My mother was heavily in to this cult stuff, but I
could pretty much ignore it apart from the constant pestering for donations. It all
went bad when the leader moved us all in to this damn bunker. I went along with it
because I couldn't bear to be separated from my mother. Turns out that happened anyway.
She died about a week after the move.

So there I was, trapped in a bunker with a bunch of strangers and too scared to try to
leave. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, the leader claps his eyes on me
and immediately declares that he is to take me as a wife. I thought someone would speak
up about an old man like him wanting to marry a 23 year old woman, but nobody said a 
word. They were all on his side. I was left with no choice but to acquiesce.

He never looks at me except for sex, or to clean his chambers. Why does he even have
his own private chambers when all the rest of have to live communally? Hell, how the fuck
am I supposed to be his wife when he won't even tell me his fucking name?

I wish I could just get the hell out of this place.
