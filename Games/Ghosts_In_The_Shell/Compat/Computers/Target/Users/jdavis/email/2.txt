Your Daughter

You better start keeping that damn daughter of yours in line. She's always Yawning and 
sneezing in the middle of the leader's sermons, and you can't fail to overhear her talking
with the damn Parker girl about how much she wishes she was out there in that sinful world.

I say you either make her understand why we're in here or giver her wish and chuck her out
there. We'll see how damn much she likes the outside when she can't come back. And don't
let her associate with that vile woman any longer; she has been causing a lot of trouble
lately.

I hope you haven't forgotten that she is to be the bride of the leader. You'd best get her
to start acting like it.

Regards,
