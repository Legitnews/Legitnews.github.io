DRAFT:

I shall call them all in to my chamber

I shall lift the cup

I shall say "Take this now and drink of it. This is the blood of the covenant,
which shall be shed for many."

In turn, we will all drink from the cup

I shall say "Assuredly, I say to you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of 
the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."

And so I will be free of this nightmare.
