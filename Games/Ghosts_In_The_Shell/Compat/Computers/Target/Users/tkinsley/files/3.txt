I thought I was rid of this accursed woman. It had been over a month since I last 
spoke to her, but apparently that was not to be. She has just come in to my room
for a "chat". Why doesn't she understand I want nothing to do with her? She reminds
me of my sin.

She seemed faraway throughout our conversation. I was trying to get rid of her the
whole time, but she kept making more and more inane statements. I remember one in
particular.

"You know what my favourite name for a baby girl is? Autumn. It's such a pretty
name. Such a lovely name for a little baby girl."

It had absolutely nothing to do with what I was trying to say. Just a completely
out of place, inane statement. This woman is insufferable.

Worst of all is that she asked me to send her an email, and in a moment of utter
foolishness I promised her that I would. I suppose I'll tell her some old, pointless
story from a while ago. That should sate her penchant for inanity.
