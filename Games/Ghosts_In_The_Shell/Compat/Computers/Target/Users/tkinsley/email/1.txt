Secure Your Account

Why do you still not have an account password? Don't you understand how important
the security of this computer system is? If this system gets infiltrated, that's
it for us. So get a damn password already, and make it a good one. The leader's
password is the maximum length, because he understands that this system damn well
has to be secure. Don't you want to be like him? Remember, "if you walk in his
ways, you shall be called blessed".

Look, I'm fed up of having to explain this. Just get it in to your head, YOU
NEED A PASSWORD.

Thanks,
