STOP THIS AT ONCE

I daren't say this aloud, so I've sent you this mail.

I know what vile acts you've been up to with that Parker woman. Repent now for your
heinous ways, surrender yourself to the lord's mercy and cease this wickedness.

She's a married woman, damn you! The wife of the leader, no less. Adultery is a 
grotesque sin, boy. Have I not raised you better than this? You had best thank 
the Lord you were born my son, as otherwise I would have informed the leader 
of your treachery.

You disgust me, boy. You are to have no more to do with this woman, do you understand?
The leader has commanded a life of celibacy for his followers and you are to observe
it, lest you incur the wrath of hell.

"And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that
committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress
shall surely be put to death."
- Leviticus 20:10

Your father,
