Dear diary,

The leader gave a big speech today about heaven and how were all going to go there
because were gods chosen people and he said we shouldnt be scared to die because god
would deliver us.

after i told daddy that i was scared to die because i want to keep living. he hugged
me really tight and i think he was crying as well.ive never seen daddy cry before.
he wouldn't say anything except after he was finished crying he told me not to worry
about it. if i shouldnt worry then why was he crying? i'm just more worried now.
