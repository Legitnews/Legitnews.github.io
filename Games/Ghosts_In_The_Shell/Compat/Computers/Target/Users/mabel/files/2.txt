Dear diary,

miss parker was playing with me yesterday again, and she helped me with my writing
like she said she would, and she helped me write a poem. i tried to show daddy but
he said he was very busy and would read it later.

I like red flowers, they smell really nice
I like flowers of orange and purple and green
I miss flowers from when I could see them
but now i forget the flowers i've seen

BY MABEL DAVIS AGE 8

i think it's really really good because miss parker helped me write it and she's
really smart and pretty and knows lots and lots about poetry. She even lended
me a book of poems by Thomas Hardy. i don't understand much of it but she says 
shell help me go through them later. Oh, and miss parker showed me a poem she
wrote as well.

A flower plucked before bloom
has no monument or tomb
my flower rests alone tonight
though I have an empty room

BY LUCY PARKER AGE 23

She showed me it because it was about flowers like mine. i don't get it though
because flowers don't sleep. i asked her to explain it to me but she said she couldnt
so maybe shes so good at poems that she writes things even she cant understand.
