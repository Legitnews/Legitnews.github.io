My Daughter

Look, maybe Mabel can be a bit outspoken at times, but she's 8 years old for God's sake.

As for becoming the leader's wife, I've been having my doubts. Have you seen the way he
sniffs around her? Messenger of God or not, I don't like people acting like that with my
daughter. I know he says they will be married when she is "of age", but he's never said
what exactly he means by that.

He might be our leader, but as her father I still have the final right to decide who
Mabel marries, and by damn am I unsure about him.

Regards,
