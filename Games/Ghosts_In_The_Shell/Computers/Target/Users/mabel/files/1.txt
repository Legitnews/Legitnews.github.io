Dear diary,

I decided to start keeping a diary today. miss parker told me that she has a
diary, and a lot of girls write diaries in my books that daddy brought for me
so i wanted to start one aswell.

In the books, when they start writing in the diary they always start with "dear
diary". i don't really understand what that means but i did it as well because
i wanted to be the same as the girls in the books. theyre always so much smarter
than me and they have adventures outside. i'm not aloud to go outside, i just
have to stay in this stupid bunker all the time and its really boring.

the leader says its very important for us all to stay in the bunker. daddy likes
the leader a lot so i trust him aswell, but i think he is kinda weird. last time
i was talking to him i asked the him to help me pick a computer password and he
said his starts with the letter j. that didn't help me choose one at all, i think
he was ignoring me. he kept talking about how i was a vergin and thats why
i have worth to him. i asked daddy what vergin means and he wouldn't tell me.
he looked kinda angry though so it probably means something bad.

i wish i was more like matilda, who is a girl in my favorite book by rolled dahl. 
she gets to go outside and go to school and everything! i cant go to school
because the leader says talking to other children would make me unclean.
i could just take a bath and be clean again, so i don't get whats the big deal.

i was talking to miss parker today. she is very nice, i like her. i was telling
her about my birthday 2 months ago and how daddy tried to make me a cake, but it
burned. she said that was very funny and she promised she would help me with my
writing later. i am trying to get better at writing. i hope i am as good as daddy
at it soon.
