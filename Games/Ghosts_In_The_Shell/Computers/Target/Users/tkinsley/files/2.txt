Forgive me father for I have sinned. I am no better that the unwashed sinners outside
out walls. I have betrayed the leader by succumbing to the temptations of his
wife.

She went on and on with her poisoned tongue until she got the better of me, and
I fornicated with her.

I couldn't possibly confess this sin to the leader. God only knows what he would
do if he knew.

Guilt consumes me. This sin will forever be a black stain on my conscience. I can
only pray that the Lord will forgive me for this insult to the leader.

On the other hand, the real blame for this sin falls on the horrible succubus
who corrupted my once-pure heart. I will have to sever all contact with that
venomous bitch. She is the mimic of Eve, who so deceived the righteous Adam
and had them both cast out of Eden.

I pray the leader does not similarly cast me out of our new Eden.

But I can't help but wonder, is the leader a good husband?
He does seem to ignore Lucy most of the time. Perhaps he too
is in part to blame for this.

NO, GOODNESS NO. It seems the devil is in me yet. OUT DEVIL, OUT.
The leader has no time for worldly concerns, he is focused on the
salvation of we, his children.

I had best stop writing to deprive the devil of his outlet. I must
go and pray for forgiveness.
