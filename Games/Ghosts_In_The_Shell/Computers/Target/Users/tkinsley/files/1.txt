temptation.txt

Dear Lord, I have sinned. I have felt the temptation of Lucifer and I must fight it.

The vile temptress Lucy Parker has been attempting to seduce me. I admit the celibate
life has been very difficult on me, but I absolutely must not allow this snake to lead
me from the path of righteousness.

But one night, just one night with her to sate my lust would be wonderful. Just once
and no more, to ease my mind, to settle my urges. No more after that.

NO, I must not be drawn in by the seductive guise of the devil. I must remember the
word of Jesus.

"And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter 
the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell"
- Mark 9:47
