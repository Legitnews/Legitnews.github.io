Hello

2021/03/02

Hello, just a quick little email to make sure you managed to get your account set up
correctly.

Speaking of which, I heard you were having trouble choosing an account password. I made
mine my favourite book of the Bible, so maybe that's an idea for you as well.

You'll have to come to my chambers for a drink again some time. Last time was a damn riot
but I think John nearly saw you on your way back. We'll have to be more careful.

Your old friend,
  The Leader
