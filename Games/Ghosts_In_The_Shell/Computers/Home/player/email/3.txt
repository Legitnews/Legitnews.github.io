We got an email from your last client. Thought you might want to see it. - The Boss.

Hi. I just wanted to say thank you again for sorting out that little "unpleasantness"
I was dealing with back in June. I still can't figure out what the hell you did, but
whatever it was sure got rid of those guys. The threatening emails have stopped and
I'm finally sleeping again at night. Your services aren't cheap but they're worth every 
penny. Some problems you just can't go to the cops with, if you know what I mean.

Thanks again,
  Fredrick Jones
